# Rector stuff

This is just a little place for my stuff, mostly in-progress releases of add-ons providing new functionality
that I may submit to the official Kodi repo at some point. The zip to install this repository in Kodi is
[repository.rector.stuff](https://github.com/rmrector/repository.rector.stuff/raw/python2/latest/repository.rector.stuff-latest.zip).

Head to branches **python3** for Kodi 19 and **python2** for Kodi 18 and below. The zip file linked above
works across all supported Kodi versions.
